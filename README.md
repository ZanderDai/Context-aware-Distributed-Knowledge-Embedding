# Context-aware Distributed Knowledge Embedding

The train.lua now contains everything, including the whole model. Yes, it is still very rough.

To run the code, install the following libraries (using luarocks):
    - cutorch
    - nn
    - cunn
    - nngraph
    - logroll (not used for now, but will be used in the future)
